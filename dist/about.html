                <h3>MUSICAL HISTORY</h3>
                <h6></h6>
                <p>The journey to this point has been long. I started my “music career” back in 2004 when I was 10 years old. After few
                years, I established my first band called “Pain of Despair” with my friends. Even I was 13 years old in 2007, we played
                our first show in festival called Astuvarock. After “Pain of Despair” I’ve played and been as featuring artist in many
                other projects and bands.
                After many years I decided to improve my playing skills and become professional guitarist. It was 2013 when I started
                new band called “Riddle Me This.” That was just a beginning. In 2016 we placed second in Finnish qualifiers in the
                World’s biggest band competition called Emergenza. Because of the success in the band competition, we have played tens
                of shows in Finland and abroad. It has been a long journey and now it is time to release our first album called
                “Universal Ego.”</p>
